## Executive Summary

Acme Corp enters 2024 at an inflection point. After achieving product-market fit in the mid-market segment and reaching $28M ARR in 2023, we are positioning for the next phase of growth. Our 2024 strategy centers on three pillars: expanding platform capabilities, accelerating enterprise adoption, and investing in developer experience. We are targeting $48M ARR by year-end, representing 71% YoY growth.

## Vision

**To become the operating system for modern business workflows** -- enabling teams of any size to automate, integrate, and orchestrate their critical processes through a single intelligent platform.

## Market Position

- **ARR:** $28M (December 2023). **Customers:** 1,200+ across 40 countries.
- **Segment mix:** 70% mid-market, 20% SMB, 10% enterprise.
- **Team:** 185 employees across San Francisco (HQ), New York, and London.
- **Market:** Workflow automation projected to reach $35B by 2027 (Gartner). AI-powered workflow orchestration growing at 42% CAGR. Acme Corp holds ~1.2% market share.
- **Competitors:** Zapier (consumer/SMB), Workato (enterprise), Tray.io (mid-market). New LLM-based entrants emerging but lack integration depth and enterprise readiness.

## Strategic Pillar 1: Platform Expansion

**Goal:** Evolve from a workflow automation tool to a comprehensive business orchestration platform.

- **AI Workflow Builder:** Natural-language workflow creation via fine-tuned LLMs. GA by Q2; 30% of new workflows via AI by year-end.
- **Integration Marketplace:** Expand from 150 to 300+ native integrations (SAP, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday). Partner connector program by Q3.
- **Real-Time Event Processing:** Sub-second event-driven triggers for fraud detection, inventory, and engagement.
- **Embedded Workflows:** SDK for customers to embed Acme workflows in their own products.

## Strategic Pillar 2: Enterprise Growth

**Goal:** Shift revenue mix from 10% to 25% enterprise, adding $8M+ in new enterprise ARR.

- **Sales:** Hire 8 enterprise AEs and 4 SEs in H1. Dedicated pods with AE + SE + CSM alignment.
- **Compliance:** SOC 2 Type II (Q1), ISO 27001 (Q3), HIPAA readiness (Q4) to unlock healthcare and financial services.
- **Features:** SSO/SCIM, audit logging, data residency, advanced RBAC, enterprise billing by Q2.
- **Partnerships:** Technology alliances with Snowflake, Databricks, and AWS. Target 3 joint case studies.

## Strategic Pillar 3: Developer Experience

**Goal:** Build a developer community that drives organic adoption and platform stickiness.

- **CLI:** Full-featured CLI for workflow dev, testing, and deployment with local hot-reload by Q2.
- **Docs:** Rewrite documentation with interactive tutorials and API playground. Target NPS 50+ (current: 32).
- **Open Source:** Open-source workflow runtime and core SDK. Target 2,000 GitHub stars.
- **DevRel:** Hire 3 developer advocates. Monthly webinars, weekly blog, 10 conference sponsorships.

## Investment Priorities

**Headcount:** Grow from 185 to 280 (+45 engineering, +25 sales/marketing, +12 CS, +13 G&A).
**Capital:** R&D 55%, Sales & Marketing 30%, G&A 15% of total spend.
**Fundraising:** Series B planned Q2, targeting $40-50M at $350-400M valuation for enterprise GTM and platform R&D.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | 2023 Actual | 2024 Target | Growth |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| ARR | $28M | $48M | 71% |
| Customers | 1,200 | 2,000 | 67% |
| Enterprise (>$100K ARR) | 12 | 35 | 192% |
| Net revenue retention | 115% | 130% | +15pp |
| Gross margin | 72% | 75% | +3pp |

## Competitive Differentiation

1. **Intelligence Layer:** Proprietary AI trained on 50M+ workflow executions enables predictive error handling, smart field mapping, and NL workflow creation that requires equivalent data scale to replicate.
2. **Developer Extensibility:** Full programmatic control via SDK, CLI, and API -- the choice for engineering-led orgs that outgrow visual-only tools.
3. **Unified Platform:** Combines integration, orchestration, and automation in a single product with shared data context, unlike competitors who offer only one.
