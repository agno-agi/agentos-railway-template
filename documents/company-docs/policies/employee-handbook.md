# Acme Corp Employee Handbook

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024
**Last Updated:** September 15, 2024
**Document Owner:** People Operations

## Section 1: Company Values

Acme Corp is built on five core values that guide every decision we make:

1. **Customer Obsession** -- We start with the customer and work backwards. Every feature, policy, and process should improve the customer experience.
2. **Bias for Action** -- Speed matters. We prefer reversible decisions made quickly over perfect decisions made slowly.
3. **Radical Transparency** -- We share context broadly so every team member can make informed decisions autonomously.
4. **Continuous Improvement** -- We invest in learning, experimentation, and iteration at every level of the organization.
5. **One Team** -- We succeed and fail together. Cross-functional collaboration is the default, not the exception.

## Section 2: Code of Conduct

All employees are expected to conduct themselves with integrity and professionalism. This includes but is not limited to:

- Treating colleagues, customers, and partners with respect and dignity.
- Avoiding conflicts of interest and disclosing any potential conflicts to your manager and the Legal team.
- Protecting confidential information belonging to Acme Corp, its customers, and its partners.
- Complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and internal policies.
- Reporting any suspected violations of this code through the Ethics Hotline or to your HR Business Partner.

Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

## Section 3: Workplace Policies

### Remote & Hybrid Work
Acme Corp operates on a hybrid model. Employees are expected to be in-office a minimum of two days per week (Tuesday and Thursday are designated anchor days). Fully remote arrangements require VP-level approval and are reviewed quarterly.

### Working Hours
Core collaboration hours are 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM in your local time zone. Beyond core hours, employees have flexibility to structure their workday as needed, provided they meet their commitments and are available for scheduled meetings.

### Workplace Safety
All employees must complete annual workplace safety training. Report any safety hazards, injuries, or near-misses to Facilities immediately via the internal Safety Portal.

## Section 4: Time Off & Leave

### Paid Time Off (PTO)
Acme Corp offers an **unlimited PTO policy** with manager approval. We trust employees to manage their time responsibly. To ensure adequate rest and prevent burnout, we recommend a **minimum of two weeks (10 business days) of PTO per year**. Requests should be submitted through Workday at least two weeks in advance for planned absences exceeding three consecutive days.

### Sick Leave
Employees receive up to 10 paid sick days per year, separate from PTO. Sick leave may be used for personal illness, medical appointments, or caring for an immediate family member.

### Parental Leave
Acme Corp provides 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave for all new parents (birth, adoption, or foster placement), regardless of gender. An additional 4 weeks at 60% pay is available upon request.

### Bereavement Leave
Up to 5 paid days for the loss of an immediate family member. Up to 3 paid days for extended family. Additional unpaid leave may be granted at manager discretion.
